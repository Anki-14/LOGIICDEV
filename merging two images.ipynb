    "Arithmetic Operations on Images in OpenCV\n",
    "In OpenCV, you can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division between images or between an image and scalar values. These operations are performed pixel by pixel, meaning the operation is applied individually to each corresponding pixel in the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are explanations of each operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Addition (cv2.add)\n",
    "Explanation: Adds the pixel values of two images, or an image and a scalar. This operation is saturated, meaning the resulting pixel value is clipped to 255 if it exceeds this maximum (for example, if the sum is 260, it will be set to 255). This prevents overflow and ensures the image intensity stays within the valid range (0-255).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "src1: First input image or scalar.\n",
    "\n",
    "src2: Second input image or scalar.\n",
    "\n",
    "dst: Output image (optional).\n",
    "\n",
    "mask: Optional operation mask; only the non-zero mask pixels are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "dtype: Desired output depth (optional).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Subtraction (cv2.subtract)\n",
    "Explanation: Subtracts the pixel values of the second image from the first. The operation is saturated to avoid negative pixel values. If the result of the subtraction is negative (e.g., 50 - 100 = -50), it is clipped to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "src1: First input image or scalar.\n",
    "\n",
    "src2: Second input image or scalar.\n",
    "\n",
    "dst: Output image (optional).\n",
    "\n",
    "mask: Optional operation mask.\n",
    "\n",
    "dtype: Desired output depth (optional).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Multiplication (cv2.multiply)\n",
    "Explanation: Multiplies the pixel values of two images or an image and a scalar. This is also saturated to ensure the pixel values stay within the range of 0-255. This operation is useful for adjusting image brightness by multiplying with a scalar value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "src1: First input image or scalar.\n",
    "\n",
    "src2: Second input image or scalar.\n",
    "\n",
    "dst: Output image (optional).\n",
    "\n",
    "scale: Scale factor to adjust the output (optional, default is 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "dtype: Desired output depth (optional).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Division (cv2.divide)\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: Divides the pixel values of one image by the corresponding pixel values of another image. If a division by zero occurs, the result is set to the maximum value (255). You can also divide an image by a scalar, which is useful for scaling down brightness or intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "src1: First input image or scalar.\n",
    "\n",
    "src2: Second input image or scalar.\n",
    "\n",
    "dst: Output image (optional).\n",
    "\n",
    "scale: Scale factor to adjust the output (optional, default is 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "dtype: Desired output depth (optional).\n",
    "\n",
    "Saturation in Arithmetic Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For all these operations, OpenCV ensures that pixel values stay within the range of 0 to 255. This is referred to as saturation arithmetic, meaning:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the resulting pixel value exceeds 255 (in addition or multiplication), it will be set to 255.\n",
    "If the resulting pixel value goes below 0 (in subtraction or division), it will be set to 0."
